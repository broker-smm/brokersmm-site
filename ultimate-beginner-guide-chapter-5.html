            <article class="post-content">
                <p>You've done the hard work: you've learned the concepts and made your first investment. Now, the final piece of the puzzle is learning how to protect your progress. Success in investing is not just about making good decisions; it's also about avoiding bad ones. Here are the five most common traps beginners fall into.</p>

                <ol class="mistake-list">
                    <li class="mistake">
                        <div class="mistake-number">1</div>
                        <div class="mistake-content">
                            <h3>Emotional Investing: The Number One Wealth Destroyer</h3>
                            <p>This is the number one wealth destroyer. It's when you sell everything in a panic because the market is down (selling low) or buy a "hot" stock out of fear of missing out (**FOMO**) when its price is already high (buying high). **How to avoid it:** Have a long-term plan and stick to it. Trust the process, not the daily news headlines.</p>
                        </div>
                    </li>
                    <li class="mistake">
                        <div class="mistake-number">2</div>
                        <div class="mistake-content">
                            <h3>Putting All Your Eggs in One Basket</h3>
                            <p>Getting excited about one company and putting all your money into its stock is a huge gamble. If that company fails, you lose everything. **How to avoid it:** **Diversify!** By buying a broad-market ETF, you've already taken the single most important step to protect yourself from this mistake.</p>
                        </div>
                    </li>
                    <li class="mistake">
                        <div class="mistake-number">3</div>
                        <div class="mistake-content">
                            <h3>Trying to "Time the Market"</h3>
                            <p>This means trying to guess the perfect time to buy (at the absolute bottom) and sell (at the absolute top). Even professionals fail at this consistently. **How to avoid it:** Focus on **"time in the market,"** not **"timing the market."** Invest consistently over a long period, and let time do the heavy lifting for you.</p>
                        </div>
                    </li>
                    <li class="mistake">

                        <div class="mistake-content">
                            <h3>Forgetting About Fees</h3>
                            <p>Small fees can add up over time and eat away at your returns significantly. A 1% fee might sound small, but over 30 years, it can consume a third of your potential earnings. **How to avoid it:** As we discussed in Chapter 3, always choose low-cost platforms and ETFs.</p>
                        </div>
                    </li>

                            <h3>Impatience</h3>
                            <p>Investing is not a get-rich-quick scheme. Building true wealth is a marathon, not a sprint. Checking your portfolio every day will only cause stress and lead to emotional decisions. **How to avoid it:** Adopt a long-term mindset. Think in terms of years and decades, not days and weeks.</p>
